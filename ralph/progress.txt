## [2026-02-22 19:15:00] - US-018: Add messaging_credit_purchase handler to payment-webhook

### Implemented
- Extended WebhookEvent interface to include credits field
- Added credits extraction from both Stripe and Paystack metadata (with parseInt to convert from string)
- Added 'messaging_credit_purchase' case to intent_type switch statement in payment-webhook
- Fetches tenant currency from tenants table for proper currency handling
- Checks if communication_credits record exists for tenant:
  - If exists: updates balance by incrementing with credits value
  - If not exists: creates new record with initial balance set to credits value
- Inserts messaging_credit_purchases record with:
  - tenant_id, credits, currency from tenant (defaults to NGN), amount (already converted from kobo/pesewas)
  - paid_via='paystack', payment_intent_id, gateway_reference
- Validates required fields (credits, tenantId, amount, paymentIntentId) before processing
- Wrapped in try-catch with error logging and success logging

### Files Changed
- supabase/functions/payment-webhook/index.ts
- ralph/prd.json (marked US-018 as passing)
- ralph/progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings
- Amount is already converted from kobo/pesewas to main currency units in webhook parsing (lines 191, 244), no additional conversion needed
- credits field must be extracted from metadata and parsed to integer (comes as string in metadata)
- Messaging credit purchases require credits, tenantId, amount, and paymentIntentId fields
- communication_credits table has tenant_id as UNIQUE constraint, so checking existence before insert/update
- Pattern mirrors US-015, US-016, and US-017 implementations: fetch context data → validate → check existence → update/insert credits → create audit record → log success/error
- credits field added to both Stripe and Paystack metadata extraction for consistency
- All acceptance criteria met: case added to switch, communication_credits balance incremented (or created if not exists), messaging_credit_purchases record inserted with all required fields, error handling implemented
- No typecheck command exists for edge functions (Deno-based)
- Pre-existing lint issues (eslint not found in supabase-client package) unrelated to this change

## [2026-02-22 19:45:00] - US-019: Create create-invoice-payment-session edge function

### Implemented
- Created supabase/functions/create-invoice-payment-session/index.ts edge function
- Function accepts invoiceId in request body with proper validation (returns 400 if missing)
- Fetches invoice with tenant data using inner join on tenants table
- Returns 404 if invoice not found
- Returns 400 if invoice status is already 'paid'
- Fetches customer email and name for Paystack transaction
- Creates payment_intent record with:
  - tenant_id, amount, currency from invoice
  - customer_email, customer_name from customers table
  - gateway='paystack', status='pending'
  - intent_type='invoice_payment'
  - paystack_reference with format 'invoice_{invoiceId}_timestamp'
- Calls Paystack POST /transaction/initialize with:
  - amount converted to kobo/pesewas (multiply by 100)
  - customer email
  - currency in uppercase
  - reference for idempotency
  - metadata containing tenant_id, invoice_id, payment_intent_id, intent_type, customer_name
- Updates invoice table with payment_link (Paystack authorization_url) and payment_intent_id
- Updates payment_intents table with paystack_access_code, paystack_reference, status='processing'
- Returns JSON with paymentUrl, reference, paymentIntentId
- Includes proper CORS headers for OPTIONS preflight and all responses

### Files Changed
- supabase/functions/create-invoice-payment-session/index.ts (created)
- ralph/prd.json (marked US-019 as passing)
- ralph/progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings
- Invoice payment flow requires fetching both invoice and customer data before initializing Paystack
- Inner join on tenants table provides tenant metadata in single query
- Paystack reference format 'invoice_{id}_{timestamp}' ensures uniqueness per invoice payment attempt
- amount converted to minor units (kobo/pesewas) by multiplying by 100 for Paystack API
- Two-step update process: first create payment_intent, then update invoice and payment_intent with Paystack response data
- Edge function follows same pattern as create-payment-session but specialized for invoice use case
- All acceptance criteria met: function created, accepts invoiceId, fetches invoice with tenant data, returns 404/400 for not found/already paid, creates payment_intent with intent_type='invoice_payment', calls Paystack with correct parameters, updates invoice and payment_intent, returns paymentUrl and reference, includes CORS headers
- No typecheck command exists for edge functions (Deno-based)
- Pre-existing lint issues (eslint not found) unrelated to this change

## [2026-02-22 20:00:00] - US-020: Create get-banks-and-momo-providers edge function

### Implemented
- Created supabase/functions/get-banks-and-momo-providers/index.ts edge function
- Function accepts country (NG or GH) query parameter (required)
- Function accepts optional type query parameter (mobile_money)
- Calls Paystack GET /bank API with country and type parameters
- For Ghana without type, sets pay_with_bank_transfer=true parameter
- Returns 400 if country parameter is missing
- Returns 500 if PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY not configured
- Returns array of banks with all required fields:
  - id, name, slug, code, type, currency
- Maps Paystack response data to Bank interface
- Includes proper CORS headers for preflight and all responses
- Error handling with try-catch and appropriate status codes

### Files Changed
- supabase/functions/get-banks-and-momo-providers/index.ts (created)
- ralph/prd.json (marked US-020 as passing)
- ralph/progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings
- Paystack /bank endpoint requires country parameter and optionally accepts type parameter
- For Ghana bank transfers (not mobile money), pay_with_bank_transfer=true must be set
- Query parameters extracted using URL.searchParams.get() for GET requests
- Bank data structure includes id, name, slug, code, type, currency fields
- Function follows same pattern as create-invoice-payment-session: CORS headers, error handling, Paystack auth header
- No typecheck command exists for edge functions (Deno-based)
- Pre-existing lint issues (eslint not found) unrelated to this change
- All acceptance criteria met: function created, accepts country and type params, calls Paystack API, handles Ghana-specific parameter, returns banks array with required fields, returns 500 if key missing, includes CORS headers

## [2026-02-22 20:30:00] - US-021: Create verify-bank-account edge function

### Implemented
- Created supabase/functions/verify-bank-account/index.ts edge function
- Function accepts accountNumber and bankCode in request body with proper validation
- Returns 400 if accountNumber or bankCode parameters are missing
- Calls Paystack GET /bank/resolve API with account_number and bank_code query params
- On success: returns verified:true with accountName, accountNumber, bankId from Paystack response
- On failure: returns verified:false with error message from Paystack or generic error message
- Returns 500 if PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY not configured
- Includes proper CORS headers for OPTIONS preflight and all responses
- Error handling with try-catch and appropriate status codes

### Files Changed
- supabase/functions/verify-bank-account/index.ts (created)
- ralph/prd.json (marked US-021 as passing)
- ralph/progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings
- Paystack /bank/resolve endpoint requires account_number and bank_code as query parameters
- Account verification returns account_name, account_number, and bank_id on success
- Verification failures should return 200 status with verified:false to allow client-side handling
- Function follows same pattern as get-banks-and-momo-providers: CORS headers, Paystack auth, error handling
- TypeScript interfaces provide type safety for request and response structures
- No typecheck command exists for edge functions (Deno-based)
- Pre-existing lint issues (eslint not found in supabase-client package) unrelated to this change
- All acceptance criteria met: function created, accepts parameters, validates inputs, calls Paystack API, returns correct response structure, includes CORS headers

## [2026-02-22 21:00:00] - US-022: Create create-payout-destination edge function

### Implemented
- Created supabase/functions/create-payout-destination/index.ts edge function
- Function requires authentication using Authorization header and getUser() verification
- Function accepts all required parameters: tenantId, destinationType, country, currency, bankCode, bankName, accountNumber, accountName, momoProvider, momoNumber, isDefault
- Validates required fields for both bank and mobile_money destination types
- For bank type: creates Paystack recipient with type='nuban' (Nigeria) or 'ghipss' (Ghana)
  - Calls Paystack POST /transferrecipient with account_number, bank_code, name, currency
- For mobile_money type: creates Paystack recipient with type='mobile_money'
  - Uses momoProvider.toUpperCase() as bank_code
  - Includes email field (required by Paystack API)
- If isDefault=true: unsets is_default on all other destinations for tenant before inserting new record
- Inserts salon_payout_destinations record with paystack_recipient_code from Paystack response
- Returns destination object on success
- Includes proper CORS headers for OPTIONS preflight and all responses
- Error handling with try-catch and appropriate status codes (400, 401, 500)

### Files Changed
- supabase/functions/create-payout-destination/index.ts (created)
- ralph/prd.json (marked US-022 as passing)
- ralph/progress.txt (this file)

### Learnings
- Paystack /transferrecipient endpoint creates recipient codes needed for transfers
- Bank recipients use type='nuban' (Nigeria) or 'ghipss' (Ghana)
- Mobile money recipients use type='mobile_money' with provider code (e.g., 'MTN', 'VODAFONE') as bank_code
- Paystack requires email field for mobile money recipients even though not used
- Authentication pattern: check bearer token → getUser() → verify user exists
- Service role client needed for database operations (user client only for auth)
- isDefault flag management: unset all existing defaults before setting new one
- All acceptance criteria met: function created with auth, accepts all parameters, validates inputs, creates Paystack recipients correctly for both types, manages is_default flag, inserts DB record with paystack_recipient_code, returns destination, includes CORS headers
- No typecheck command exists for edge functions (Deno-based)
- Pre-existing lint issues (eslint not found) unrelated to this change
